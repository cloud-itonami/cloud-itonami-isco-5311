# cloud-itonami-isco-5311

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 5311**: Child Care Workers.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent child care worker: an activity-assist robot supports supply setup and area monitoring alongside — never instead of — a supervising adult, under a governor-gated actor, so the practice keeps its own care and safety records instead of renting a closed childcare-management SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a supervised activity-assist robot performs supply setup, activity timing and area monitoring — always alongside, never instead of, an adult caregiver under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Child Care Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
any unsupervised child interaction, or activity involving food, medication or physical contact) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
guardian consent + care plan + supervision ratio requirement
        |
        v
Care Advisor -> Child Care Governor -> supervise/log, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.
